## 14. Changes Since Last Report

Compared to previous report (`code-stats-2026-02-13.json`, covering 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-13):

| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Commits | 553 | 928 | +375 (+67.8%) |
| Lines Added | 138,423 | 229,402 | +90,979 (+65.7%) |
| Lines Removed | 57,464 | 74,805 | +17,341 (+30.2%) |
| Merged PRs | 291 | 285 | -6 (-2.1%) |
| Issues Created | 323 | 464 | +141 (+43.7%) |
| Issues Closed | 209 | 303 | +94 (+45.0%) |

**Key changes:**
- **+375 commits** (+67.8%) in 12 additional days, driven by berlin-reunion (198 new commits) and accelerated sports-card-tracker activity
- **berlin-reunion** is a newly tracked repository since the last report, contributing 59 merged PRs and 109 issues
- **sports-card-tracker** saw major acceleration (+117 commits, +36 PRs)
- Merged PRs total appears slightly lower due to variance in GitHub API query results for clahub and rims (see Notes)

## 15. Notes

### Methodology
- Merge commits are excluded from all commit counts
- Binary files are excluded from line counts
- Generated/vendored files excluded: lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, etc.), `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, `*.bundle.js`, `*.generated.*`
- Test files classified by directory (`test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`) and file naming conventions (`*.test.ts`, `*_test.go`, `test_*.py`, etc.)
- PR sizes reported by GitHub may include lock files and generated code not filtered in our git numstat analysis
- High avg issue resolution times in clahub and rims reflect old issues (created years before 2026) being closed during this period

### Caveats
- All repositories have GitHub data available
- fusion94.org `_site/` directory churn is from Jekyll build artifacts committed to the repo
- The `fusion94` profile repo includes automated SVG updates from GitHub Actions (profile stats, streak badges)
- sports-card-tracker GitHub PR size metric (56,527 avg) is inflated by unfiltered generated/lock file diffs in GitHub's API
